# XssJsScanner
This JavaScript application scans websites for XSS vulnerabilities. It was developed using Apache Tomcat as part of my Web Technology exam project during my bachelor's degree. The project requirements included the use of JavaScript and Java Servlets. JavaScript performs the scanning to identify potentially vulnerable web elements, while a Java Servlet handles the upload and processing of XML files generated by the scans.
